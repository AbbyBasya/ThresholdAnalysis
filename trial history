# create list of trial types
# create list of lick/no lick (or reward/punish)
# bin the lists into chunks
# for every element in list, if it's a 6:3 for example, then determine if the elements n before it contained an airpuff
# then compare how many of the 6:3 that had vs  didn't have airpuff n before it resulted in licks
# start with just 1 before, iterate to 5 before, see  where strongest effect
# do for females vs males, light vs dark
